## ✨ Key Features

### 🗣️ Smart Word Mode (কথায় রূপান্তর)
- **Real-time Conversion:** Instantly converts inputs and results from numbers to Bengali text (e.g., `12.5` → `বারো দশমিক পাঁচ`).
- **Large Number Support:** Accurately handles large figures using the South Asian numbering system (**Lakh**, **Crore**).
- **Decimal Precision:** Smartly reads out digits after the decimal point.

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Neumorphism Design:** Soft, realistic, and tactile button effects that feel like pressing real physical buttons.
- **Ultra-Smooth Response:** Optimized for zero-lag touch response on mobile devices (`touch-action: manipulation`).
- **Dynamic Interface:** Buttons change their labels from digits (৭, ৮, ৯) to words (সাত, আট, নয়) when switching modes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure and layout.
- **CSS3:** Advanced styling using CSS Variables, Grid Layout, and Neumorphic shadows.
